# hands-on-rust
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
=======

Practices:
 - hello_world:
      This folder contains a simple program that outputs "Hello, world!" to the console. We use `rustc main.rs` to compile the program and `./main` to run it.
 - hello_cargo:
      In this project, we use `cargo` as our build tool.
      We use following commands:
       - `cargo build`
       - `cargo run`
       - `cargo check`
